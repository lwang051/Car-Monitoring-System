# Vehicle-Location-Monitoring-System
This is a system that monitors vehicles' locations on google maps. In real life vehicles are running on roads and real-time data such as the latitude and the longitude are gathered from the moving vehicles themselves, while in this project a simulation service is introduced as a substitution of the otherwise much heavier work.
